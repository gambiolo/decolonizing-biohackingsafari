## documenting anthropocenic ways of living with the trouble
studies on origins, behaviors, physical, social, cultural development of the ''biohacking society'' at large, great ideas are often articulated by communities.

-A Decade ago a collaborative non-profit [Biohacking Safari](https://www.flickr.com/photos/79382209@N05/sets/?fbclid=IwAR02Tu1dptDLE2LMHFWjO0JiL_E5B7dy1zAO5iBM3kDxnuLrrV_I6qXmB50) explored 'rich priviledge western narrative' where hackers and [biologists](https://soundcloud.com/quitteriel) worked in communal and creative spaces. We also curated workshops/lectures/articles often blending science fiction and anthropology with the aim to provoc debat.

.

The name ''BIOHACKING SAFARI'' (BS) was founded in Paris in 2014 at a time when the Californian (and Bostonian) ideologies were the dominant narratives. We anthropologically explored these dominant biohacking narratives. Especialy how the maker movement was collonising the whole world with the californian ideologies. We had to get deeper into the rabbit hole to get deeper at the core of these ideologies. 

We learned that behind marketing and branding, an image can manipulate way much more than words can do,  especially from institutions such as MIT Medialab that promotes 'open source transparency' and ''bio-ethic'' in academia, but it realy felt like shadowing the power structures of a greater colonial matrix beneath...hello Github;)
.


Hopefully in our search for 'scenius' communities we found in Brazil the perfect way to decolonize biohacking safari by remixing the GAMBIARRA narrative.

#GAMBIOLOGY is the science and practice of tinkering/reparing & Making things work again. It is a form of decolonial cosmotechnic that emerges from precariousness lifestyle. It felt like it was invented by someone from the futur to show us western high-tech consumers some degrowth prospectives...let's hope academia do not reapropriate this culture too fast, because they will.

### So from now on Biohacking Safari will be:

Do you wanna G.I.T ? (Get.it.Together) 


Why GIT tho?


because GiT is a software for tracking changes in any set of files, it's usually used for coordinating works among collaborative coding workflows.

Sadly GITHUB belongs to Microsoft but we planning on decolonizing that too soon... we're just at the lab for the moment studying how the 'octopus' behave.

Viens on s√®me ?
